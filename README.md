## 🍃 Functional Programming in Java and JavaScript 🍃

Welcome to the repository dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of functional programming, all through the lens of Java and, soon, JavaScript. 

This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing various concepts of functional programming using Java.
The project is structured to explain individual topics,how Lambda Expression work in Java, each methods of Stream API,making it easy for learners or readers to navigate and understand each concept.
